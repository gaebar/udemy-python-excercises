; Use pytest.ini only if you want to customized pytest. For example: 
; Instead of using the common test_widget_fails():
; I can write the pytest.ini and ad python_files = choice_test*
; this means that from now on Pytest will recognise the choice_test as test_*


[pytest]
python_files = test_*
python_classes = *Tests
